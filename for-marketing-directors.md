**You're a Marketing director for HackRU! Awesome :) I put this doc together hopefully to help you get a better understanding for what directors are responsible for!**

## Introduction
### Responsibilities of a Marketing director
- planning and initiating HackRU Marketing goals with organizers + directors
- planning and leading meetings with Marketing team
- using [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com) to create and send out mass hacker emails
- weekly meetings with other HackRU Directors in both large team and one-on-one settings

### Marketing works with other HackRU teams!
- Design creates all of the graphics that we can use for social media and physical advertisements
- Research and Development (RnD) works with us for registration by giving email lists for registration/acceptance waves
- Many teams rely on us to put information on our social media and website
- A lot more! Be sure to check with other directors if they would like anything from Marketing

## Marketing Team/Organizer Logistics
### Timeline
[This is a rough outline of a Marketing timeline](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10NLWnZ7HYFjVzcVCdrangDseJ7zgrZBTWuKgmFdrWqU/edit). Lots of stuff often depends on other teams (like RnD), so coordinate with them!

[Here's some outlines of organizer roles](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AGixBBUjDLkrPvOrkb5kpFraM7AYzPzGCyZsqFhVLCA). It's best to have defined roles for each organizer, and also not have *too* many organizers for each role (less confusion with who is posting what and any login issues with too many people per account ~~looking at you, Instagram~~)
Try to have at least 2 dedicated photo/video organizers at the event!

### Interviewing + new Marketing organizers
First thing I did was ask existing Marketing organizers if they want to stay on the team for the next semester's HackRU. Sometimes organizers leave, and that'll help determine how many new organizers you want to take on. For the 2 semesters where I was Marketing Director, I had 7 organizers. I was the sole Marketing director and it was decently manageable for me, although I know a team-wide goal is to have a smaller organizing team, so consider that too (a smaller, more dedicated Marketing team, while also making sure no one's burned out)!

For Marketing organizers, the top things I asked about/looked for:
- Prior experience (social media, organizing events, photos/videos/editing -> also ask for examples if they have any)
- How much time per week could they dedicate to HackRU (meetings, social media posts, photo/video editing, etc)
- Also if they have other committments like work, other clubs, etc. I tried to gauge whether the candidate would be able to effectively contribute to HackRU if they have a full plate for the semester.
- Enthusiasm for HackRU *woot woot* (how they heard about HackRU, any suggestions for HackRU, etc)
- Responsiveness and communication (how often they check email/Discord and are they in general good at responding)

### Passwords
Any HackRU account login/security info should **never** be shared publicly! So obviously I'm not putting the passwords here. o.o 

After figuring out which organizers are responsible for which accounts, use DMs to send login info. Also, good to remind organizers, especially those new to the team, to not share HackRU account info. I sent this to all my organizers:

> Please keep in mind the following:
> 1. Do not share account/login information for any HackRU account with anyone without clearing it with me or one of the executive directors.
> 2. Do not use the HackRU accounts for personal use. Remember you are representing the entire HackRU organization to the public, which includes current and potential hackers and sponsors. Improper use of HackRU accounts may result in your removal from the organizing team.


I've never had any issues with people sharing HackRU account info, but I think it might have happened in the past (maybe not with Marketing accounts, but */shrug* so YEAH KEEP THOSE PASSWORDS SECURE. Might be good to change them up once in a while, just be sure to record any changes for future marketing directors + probably execs too)
