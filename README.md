A repo about HackRU Marketing for the organizing team! :)

### *about me*
Hi, it's Emily. I was Marketing Director for HackRU for the Fall 2019 and Spring 2020 ~~(F in chat for the actual event though due to COVID-19)~~ semesters.

I wanted to share some information and resources that will hopefully be useful to future Marketing directors! Most of this info is about Marketing-related things, but I hope anyone from the HackRU organizing team can benefit from this too!

I will always be happy to help (and update this repo as needed). You probably already know how to reach me-- or just send me an email. :)
