Outreach is important for letting people know about HackRU! Market to students from Rutgers and other schools.

# Rutgers On-Campus
Reach out to clubs so they can tell their members about HackRU. Ask professors to post on Sakai or send an email to students.

Design makes the designs for our flyers and student center TV graphic!

For the flyers, just print out a bunch in color and put up around campus!

For the student center TVs, email **scsignage@echo.rutgers.edu** and include the graphic and a date range of when the graphic should be up on the TVs (ASAP through one day after the event is what I did). Bump if they don't respond within a week.

# Other Hackathons
Easy way to reach students from other schools is to reach out to the hackathon organizations
For Spring 2020, we came up with an [outreach doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_ga16VJU6mGfgy5lk-fr60p_i-I7yzoGHD8tGWECeqo) that includes our main blurb, graphics, and sample copy-paste texts for Twitter, etc.
Quite a few other hackathons include this in their outreach emails to us, so I think it's good for HackRU to have one too! It's really easy to use.

Reach out to other hackathons via personal contacts, email, and social media (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter).
